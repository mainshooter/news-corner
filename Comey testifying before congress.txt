Former FBI director James Comey will testify publicly before the Senate intelligence committee on his role in the development of the investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 US elections. 
Comey has been at the heart of the scandals enveloping the white house after President Trump fired him while he was leading the FBI’s investigation on possible ties between Russian officials and the Trump campaign last election-year.
Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner stated that Comey's testimony would help ‘’answer some of the questions that have arisen since Director Comey was so suddenly dismissed by the President”.
The committee said in a recent statement that it plans to schedule the hearing for after Memorial Day.
