Three mechanics from poiing have caused 4 milion dollars of damage. 

The oxygen system in air Force one on one of the 2 aircraft was contaminated while the plane was going under maintenance.

The mechanics made this mistake by using and supplying non-oxygen clean tools and parts, components, a regulator and an unauthorized cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak checks.
